            Keep in mind that this easy roaming only covers Zone 1 countries within the EU, following RLAH (Roam Like At Home) regulations. So, while you can call and text back to the UK or within the country you&apos;re visiting, calls to international destinations, premium, or special numbers arenâ€™t included.
